# 🌾 Maji Ndogo Agriculture Project

## Maji Ndogo Farm Insights  
### *Unlocking Ethical Agricultural Intelligence from Integrated Field Data*

> **"When it comes to data for social impact, accuracy isn’t optional—it’s ethical."**


## Project Overview
**Transforming Raw Agricultural Data into Actionable Farming Intelligence**

This comprehensive analysis tackles one of Africa's most pressing challenges: optimizing agricultural production in variable climate conditions. Using farm survey data from Maji Ndogo, we built a data-driven framework to answer two fundamental questions: **Where should we farm, and what should we grow?**

## The Challenge
Maji Ndogo faces complex agricultural decisions with:
- **Variable rainfall patterns** across regions
- **Diverse soil types** with different fertility levels  
- **Changing climate conditions** affecting crop suitability
- **Limited resources** requiring optimal allocation

## Key Insights Uncovered
### Crop Suitability Analysis
```python
# Identified optimal growing conditions for 8 major crops
- Tea: 1,534mm rainfall at 775m elevation
- Maize: 897mm rainfall at 682m elevation  
- Cassava: 1,102mm rainfall at 654m elevation
```

### 🏔️ Geographic Optimization
- **Highland zones** (>1500m): Ideal for tea and coffee
- **Mid-altitude** (500-1500m): Optimal for maize and potatoes
- **Lowland areas** (<500m): Best for cassava and rice

### 🌡️ Climate Impact Assessment
- Temperature ranges directly correlate with crop yields
- Rainfall patterns significantly influence crop selection
- Climate stability scores help predict farming success

## Technical Implementation
### Data Architecture
```python
# Multi-table SQLite database integration
geographic_features → Field locations, elevation, slopes
weather_features → Rainfall, temperature ranges  
soil_and_crop_features → Soil types, fertility, pH levels
farm_management → Crop choices, yields, pollution data
```

### Analytical Framework
```python
# Core analytical pipeline
1. Data Extraction → SQL joins across multiple tables
2. Data Cleaning → Type correction, outlier handling
3. Exploratory Analysis → Statistical summaries, visualizations  
4. Insight Generation → FAO-aligned recommendations
```

## 📈 Business Impact
### Strategic Value
- **More efficient** crop selection through data-driven decisions
- **Risk reduction** via climate-aware farming recommendations
- **Resource optimization** by matching crops to optimal conditions
- **Scalable framework** applicable to any agricultural region

## Methodology
### Data Sources
- **Field Surveys**: 5,654 farm records across Maji Ndogo
- **Geographic Data**: Elevation, coordinates, slope measurements
- **Climate Records**: Rainfall patterns, temperature ranges
- **Soil Analysis**: Fertility scores, pH levels, soil types

### Analytical Approach
1. **Data Integration**: SQL-based table joins for unified dataset
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated cleaning and validation checks
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Statistical summaries and pattern identification
4. **Visual Storytelling**: Clear charts communicating key insights
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: FAO-aligned farming guidance

## Skills Demonstrated
### Technical Competencies
- **Data Wrangling**: SQL queries, Pandas transformations, data cleaning
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, group aggregations, outlier detection
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, agricultural data storytelling
- **Database Management**: SQLAlchemy, multi-table joins, query optimization

## Future Work
### Coming in Part 2: "The Data Detective"
**Ground Truth Validation & Advanced Analytics**

```python
# Planned Investigations:
- Satellite imagery correlation with survey data
- Real-time sensor network validation
- Machine learning yield predictions
- Climate change impact modeling
- Economic optimization algorithms
```

**Research Questions:**
- Are our yield patterns statistically significant or data artifacts?
- How do microclimates within regions affect crop performance?
- Can we predict optimal planting times using historical patterns?
